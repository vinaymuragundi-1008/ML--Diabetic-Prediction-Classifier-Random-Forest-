**🩺 Diabetic Prediction System using Machine Learning**

**📌 Project Overview**

The Diabetic Prediction System is a Machine Learning–based web application developed using Python and Flask on Random forest.
The system predicts the risk level of diabetes based on patient health data and displays the prediction result along with risk percentage in a user-friendly web interface.
This project helps in early detection of diabetes and demonstrates the practical use of ML models integrated with a web framework.
shows graphs as per predict the diabetic risk level.
